# BetterTouchTool legacy version
This is a legacy version of BetterTouchTool app created by Andreas Hegenberg with a free license, taken from Andreas' old website [boastr.net](https://boastr.net).
All new versions of BetterTouchTool with more advanced feature can be found at his new website [Folivora.ai](https://folivora.ai).

I am in no way taking any credit in creation of this software, nor am I infringing on anyone's copyright, I'm simply making a copy of an already Free to use version of this fantastic app, just in case the old website goes down.

Both the BetterTouchTool software and its Free Legacy License are taken directly from the aforementioned website. This repository is created simply for preservation's sake.
